            <p>
                HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of web pages, defining their structure and content. 
                It uses elements and tags to specify how content like text, images, and links should be displayed in a browser. 
                HTML provides the basic framework for websites, organizing information into headings, paragraphs, lists, and more.

            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). 
                CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

            <summary>JavaScript Basics Summary</summary>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted programming language primarily used to add interactivity to websites. 
                It's lightweight, cross-platform, and runs directly in web browsers without needing compilation. 
                JavaScript manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) to modify HTML and CSS, enabling features like form validation, animations, and dynamic content updates. 
                It supports object-oriented programming concepts and uses a syntax similar to Java and C. 
                While often associated with client-side web development, JavaScript can also be used server-side with Node.js.
